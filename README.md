## Resource with theater plays in Chicago, IL, and its closest suburbs

### Why?
I like going to theaters, and I wouldn't say I like the visual style and searching filters from existing websites.

### Realization and tools
The main process that made this possible is web scraping. And for my project, I used the [HtmlUnit](https://htmlunit.sourceforge.io/) to extract data from HTML pages.

Thanks to [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) template engine, I created the HTML view for my website.

**Other technologies and tools:** Java, Spring MVC, HTML. 

[chicagoplays.com](https://chicagoplays.com/) is a theatrical events data extraction source.
